    <h1>Sehe Choi's Assignment 1: Blink!</h1>
    <h2>Schematic</h2>
    <div class="document">
      <img src="A1-Schematic.jpg" />
      <p>
        The circuit schematic shows three 220Ω resistors (R1, R2, and R3) connected to three red LED
        lights (LED 1, LED 2, and LED 3) and digital pins 8, 12, and 13 on an Arduino Uno. To the
        right of the schematic are the calculations for resistance, given 5V of power and a desired
        current of 20mA or less. We assume that there is a voltage drop of 1.8V across a single red
        LED. The calculations showed that a resistance of 160Ω or greater for each LED would be
        appropriate for the circuit.

    <h2>Circuit</h2>
    <div class="document">
      <p>
        The circuit utilizes three digital pins to ensure that each resistor/LED pair gets 5V of
        power and is able to operate independently. All components are connected to ground using the
        negative rail of the breadboard.

    <h2>Operation</h2>
    <div class="document">
      <img src="A1-GIF.GIF" />
      <p>
        The LEDs are programmed to blink one at a time, but the code could be altered to make them
        blink in a different order or speed. For example, the code in the firmware section delays
        blinking by 1000ms, but in the GIF, there is only a 100ms delay.

    <h2>Additional Questions</h2>
    <div class="questions">
      <p>
        1. As represented in the following graph, the voltage across one LED holds at 1.8V for one
        second before dropping to 0V for one second, and then the cycle repeats for the next LED in
        the circuit.
      </p>

        2. The Arduino Uno has 14 digital pins. To blink LEDs independently, each LED would typically
        require one pin, so in theory, the Arduino could blink up to 14. However, that depends on
        whether or not it could handle the sum of currents drawn from each resistor/LED pair. For this
        assignment, the sum of currents could be up to 280mA, equal to 20mA times 14.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Based on visual observation, a range of 10-12ms is where the LEDs appear to no longer be
        blinking.
