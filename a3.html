    <h2>Schematic</h2>
    <div class="document">

      <p>
        The circuit schematic shows a voltage divider circuit composed of one photoresistor and one
        10kΩ resistor. The output voltage of the circuit is measured using analog pin 0. The
        schematic also includes two red LED/220Ω resistor pairs. One of the LEDs is connected to PWM
        pin 9, which allows it to fade on and off, while the other is connected to digital pin 8. To
        the right of the schematic are the calculations used to estimate the range of output
        voltages produced by the voltage divider. Using the dark and light resistance values
        provided by the datasheet for the photoresistor, I checked that the 10kΩ resistor was
        suitable for use with the photoresistor, meaning that it would result in visible differences
        in light intensity. For the 220Ω resistors, given 5V of power, a desired current of 20mA or
        less, and a voltage drop of 1.8v across a single LED, I calculated that a resistance of 160Ω
        or greater would be appropriate. 220Ω resistors were selected only because they were the
        most readily available.

    <h2>Circuit</h2>
    <div class="document">
      <p>
        The circuit is split into three components: the voltage divider, the fading LED, and the
        indicator LED that signals when the voltage divider is reading approximately 5V. As
        previously described, the voltage divider is connected to analog pin 0, where its
        output voltage is read and used to control the state of the two LEDS.

    <h2>Operation</h2>
    <div class="document">
      <img src="A3-GIF.GIF" />
      <p>
        The circuit operates by reading the output voltage of the voltage
        divider, which varies according to the amount of light received by the
        photoresistor. The output value that is read is converted from 10 to 8
        bits, by scaling down the range from 0-1023 to 0-255. The duty cycle of
        the fading LED is then set to the scaled output value, and the indicator
        LED lights up if the value is approximately 5V (253 or greater).

    <h2>Additional Questions</h2>
    <div class="questions">
      <p>
        1. According to my calculations below, where I solved for the output
        voltage of my circuit when R1 is fixed and R2 is variable and vice
        versa, the variable resistor can be either R1 or R2 and does not have to
        be one or the other. Although the calculated voltages are not the same,
        they still vary between different levels of resistance, and they would
        likely result in visible differences in light intensity (if used to
        control an LED).

        2. In this graph of voltage over time (in seconds) at V-measure of my
        voltage divider, I included lines for both the raw sensor values and the
        adjusted values after calibration. The max voltage for the sensor line
        is ~2.5V because the highest value read using the serial monitor was
        469, about half of the input voltage (1023 or 5V). The lowest value was
        18, so the min voltage for the sensor line is just above zero. For the
        adjusted line, the max voltage goes up to 5V and the min voltage goes
        down to 0V due to the use of the map and constrain functions.

        3. For an 8-bit PWM and 10-bit analog-to-digital converter, my map()
        code would look like:
        <pre>
          <code>
            sensorValue = map(sensorValue, 0, 1023, 0, 255);
          </code>
        </pre>
        If I had a 10-bit PWM and a 16-bit converter, I would scale my code to
        look like this:
        <pre>
          <code>
            sensorValue = map(sensorValue, 0, 65535, 0, 1023);
          </code>
        </pre>
        I just have to make sure that I match the min and max values with the
        new PWM and converter ranges. If the syntax for the map function is
        map(value, fromLow, fromHigh, toLow, toHigh), then fromLow and fromHigh
        correspond to the min and max values for the 16-bit converter, and
        toLow and toHigh correspond to the min and max values for the 10-bit PWM.
